Open Table has a public API available at https://platform.opentable.com/documentation/#authorization that you can use to get restaurant information, including restaurant details and delivery information.
As an example, http://opentable.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants?city=toronto returns a list of restaurants that deliver to Toronto, including some basic restaurant information.
 
The task is to create an application that accepts an City as a parameter. The application should then display the following information about each restaurant that delivers to that City:
•Name
•Address
•Price
Platform Choice
You can create the application as a web application in any of the following platforms
·        JavaScript Native
·        ReactJS
·        Polymer
·        Angular
·        VueJS
