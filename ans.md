I decided to create this app in angularjs as I found that it is the best suitable framework for a single page application such as the task give.
I spend almost 5 hours completing this challange. Learning the syntactical implentation of Angular and implementing it took me this time as i was new Angular.
2. I have used the AngularJs. i.e. the first version of Angular. there are many updates to angular happened since than. currently the latest version in use is Angular5 which is syntactically different than Angularjs.
well there are many new features introduced in it : 
  1) better optimization techniques
  2) faster builds
  3) a new options for form fields i.e. updateOn, checks for validity on blur or submit.
  5) additional router events.
  6) and many more
3. there are many ways we can test for performance issue in production. generally speaking performance of any application is related to the following things: 
  1) Slow SQL statements or excessive sql queries 
  2) slow web Service calls
  3) slow response or coupling with third party application 
  4) exaustion of connection pool
  5) Excessive cache usage etc. 
  thus tracking for the above helps to find bugs or problems that are affecting performance of an applicaions.
  You can also use the developers tools to analyse the response time of a request from the server which might help to find the appropriate cause. 
  using tools such as wireshark which helps in packate sniffing to look for additional data to help diagnose performance issue in a web application

I havent created any api to handle the request. But I can create the api using python/write language you are comfortable with.
